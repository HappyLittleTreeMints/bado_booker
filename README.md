What's up nerds, are you annoyed of having to book badminton for 2:15?
Are you sick of a bunch of cringelords waking up early and booking all the courts?
Well never fear, because BIG CHEUNGUS is here.

I, completely by myself without the help of AI, wrote some trash selenium code to solve this problem.
However, it is not yet finished. 

It gets up to the Payment Summary Screen, so I'll need someone to close it out due to membership stuff.
Should be quite simple, just copy pasta some of the other lines of code.
Also, there's the matter of task scheduling. No idea if anyone has some cloud stuff or just keeps their pc on like an absolute degenerate.

pip install selenium
